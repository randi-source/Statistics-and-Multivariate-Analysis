#### Note

- Another topic that covered in this course were Factor Analysis, Clustering, Discriminant Analysis, Multiple Regression, Conjoint Analysis, and Structural Equation Modelling. This algorithms were not covered in this repo since I was not given the task. Nevertheless, all of multivariate analysis approach were worth to study with.

- Most of the analysis were done in R language using R-Markdown files, some using Python in Jupyter-Notebook. There were also html files attached that you can open in your browser
