Another topic that covered in this course were Factor Analysis, Clustering, Discriminant Analysis, Multiple Regression, Conjoint Analysis, and Structural Equation Modelling. This algorithms were not covered in this repo since I was not given the task. Nevertheless, all of multivariate analysis approach were worth to study with.
